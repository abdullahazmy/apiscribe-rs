# apiscribe (Rust)

An AI CLI built on Claude that writes API documentation for **frontend and mobile developers**, shipped as a single native binary. Run it in your backend repo and it reads the code (routes, controllers, DTOs, validators, middleware, error handlers), then writes docs that show every endpoint's expected request, its responses, and its errors. Give it a screenshot of an app screen and it tells you which APIs that screen should call.

This is the Rust version of [apiscribe](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/apiscribe). There is also a [Go version](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/apiscribe-go). All three share the same prompts, commands, and output.

```

## Install

Download a binary for Linux, macOS, or Windows from [Releases](https://github.com/abdullahazmy/apiscribe-rs/releases), or build it with a recent stable Rust (edition 2024):

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/abdullahazmy/apiscribe-rs
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` before running it. `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` and `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` also work.

PDF export uses an installed Chrome, Chromium, or Edge. It finds the common install locations on its own; to point it at a different binary, set `APISCRIBE_CHROME=/path/to/chrome`. Without a browser, the Markdown and HTML exports still work.

## Usage

### Interactive

```bash
cd my-backend
apiscribe
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/scan [focus]` | Finds every endpoint and writes `README.md` plus `endpoints/<resource>.md`. Run it again to update the docs. |
| `/endpoint <what>` | Documents or updates one endpoint, e.g. `/endpoint POST /api/orders` |
| `/image [paths…] [-- note]` | Maps app screens to the APIs they should call. With no path it reads the image from the clipboard. You can also drag an image file into the terminal. |
| `/export [md\|html\|pdf\|all]` | Builds single-file `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `.html`, and `.pdf` files in `api-docs/dist/` |
| `/docs` | Lists the generated files |
| `/effort [level]` | Sets reasoning effort: `low`, `medium`, `high` (default), `xhigh`, or `max` |
| `/cost` | Shows token usage and estimated cost |
| `/clear` | Starts a new conversation. Docs on disk are kept. |

Anything else you type goes to Claude as a chat message. Press ctrl+c while Claude is working to interrupt it. Press ctrl+c at an empty prompt, or ctrl+d, to exit. Tab completes slash commands.

### One-shot (scripts and CI)

```bash
apiscribe generate                      # scan, then export md + html + pdf
apiscribe generate "only the payments module" --format html
apiscribe image login.png home.png -n "customer mobile app"
apiscribe endpoint POST /api/v1/cart/items
apiscribe export --format pdf           # render only, no AI calls
apiscribe -C ../other-service -o docs/api generate
```

Global flags: `-C/--project`, `-o/--docs-dir` (default `api-docs`), `-m/--model` (default `claude-opus-5-5`), and `-e/--effort`. You can also set them through the environment variables `APISCRIBE_MODEL`, `APISCRIBE_EFFORT`, and `APISCRIBE_DOCS_DIR`.

## What the docs contain

For each endpoint:

- auth requirements
- headers
- tables of path, query, and body parameters, with types, constraints, and defaults
- a curl example
- every response status, each with a realistic JSON example that matches the real serializer
- TypeScript types
- client notes covering pagination, retries, rate limits, and side effects

Each screen mapping (`screens/<name>.md`) lists:

- which calls to make when the screen loads, and their order
- which endpoint each UI action calls
- which response field fills each UI element
- loading, empty, and error states
- **missing APIs**: things the screen needs that the backend doesn't provide yet

## Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `src/main.rs` | The CLI (clap) |
| `src/api.rs` | A small streaming client for the Claude Messages API over raw HTTP (reqwest + SSE), since there is no official Rust SDK. It retries 429/5xx and connection errors, and ctrl+c cancels promptly. |
| `src/agent.rs` | The tool-use loop. It uses Claude Opus 5.5 with adaptive thinking, shows progress notes, has prompt caching on, and enables server-side refusal fallback. The history is append-only. |
| `src/tools.rs` | `list_files`, `read_file`, and `search` (ripgrep, with a pure-Rust fallback) can only read inside the project. `write_doc` can only write inside the docs directory. |
| `prompts/` | The system prompt and task prompts, as plain Markdown, compiled into the binary |
| `src/image.rs` | Loads images from a file path or the clipboard (Wayland, X11, macOS, Windows) |
| `src/export.rs` | pulldown-cmark + syntect for HTML, headless_chrome for PDF; the CSS and JS are compiled into the binary |
| `src/repl.rs` | The interactive session (rustyline) |

Release binaries are built by GitHub Actions whenever a `v*` tag is pushed.
